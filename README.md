## No Frills React

### Pure React

* [Lesson Outline](https://react-v8.holt.courses/lessons/no-frills-react/pure-react)

#### Creating our first Pure React Component

``` javascript
const App = () => {
        return React.createElement(
          "div",
          {},
          React.createElement("h1", {}, "Adopt Me!")
        )
      };
```

Components are always capitalised. This is required and becomes more important when we start using JSX. In this example our component is called App.

The function will return the results of whatever the React.createElement does: 

1. The element to create, in this example a div.
2. An object with whatever attributes you want to assign to the element, such as a style tag or a class name, ID etc. There has to be something passed here, so you can also use an empty object, or null (which essentially mean the same thing to React). 
3. The children of the element, so this will go inside the div. In this example we have a h1, with no attributes and the raw text adopt me.

`createElement` = creates new HTML tags

So now we have our function, we need to instantiate it, so it shows in the browser:

``` javascript
const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(React.createElement(App));
```

First we create a container to place our component, in this example, we are using the div with the ID of root as the container for our component. This could be called anything, but typically it is called root.

We then need to create the root, which we pass the container to. (In older versions of React this would be done with `ReactDOM.render(container, <App />);` - this can still be found if you are using an older version of React, but has been replaced by the new, better `createRoot` in React 18.)

Finally we use createElement to render the App in the root - attributes and children can also be added here after the App, however as we don't have any we can just omit them here.

Note that although this uses createElement, this time we are passing it a component rather than a string. If you gave it text in a string, it would render that as the tag name. If you give it a component, it will render that component out.

This will probably be the last time you write code using React.createElement etc, as React developers use JSX. However, JSX gets compiled down into JavaScript like shown above, so it is helpful to be able to understand how this works. It is also helpful to know for when createElement shows on stack tracing, as you will understand why its there.

### Components

* [Lesson Outline](https://react-v8.holt.courses/lessons/no-frills-react/components)

We can put the contents of our script into its own Javascript file called App.js and add that as the source in our script tags (note the capitalisation of App)

We are then going to create a pet component in App.js

``` JavaScript
const Pet = () => {
  return React.createElement("div", {}, [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "Bubba"),
    React.createElement("h2", {}, "Dog"),
    React.createElement("h2", {}, "English Bulldog"),
  ])
};
```

Note that for this component, we have passed it an array of child elements to render. As we've used an array in the pets component, we will also change it in the App component to use an array, as we are going to add three pet components there.

When we add the Pet component into the App component 3 times, it displays the content of the Pet component three times. However this is not ideal, as in the real world we would want to be able to have a bit more flexibility of displaying different pets.

React uses one way data flows - which means we can pass data from App down to Pet, but we can't pass data from Pet up to App. As we know that the parent App can affect the Children, but not the other way around, it makes it more straightforward when it comes to debugging. It also makes the data flow explicit, as if Pet has weird data being passed into it, you'll know that its source is the App, as the data flows from parent to child.

So to pass properties from the parent to the child we will need to pass props as an argument into the Pet function, and then state the name of the props within the element, note that props are not strings:

``` Javascript
const Pet = (props) => {
  return React.createElement("div", {}, [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, props.name),
    React.createElement("h2", {}, props.animal),
    React.createElement("h2", {}, props.breed),
  ])
};
```

Then in App, we can pass the data we want to use to populate the props, note that this data is in strings, but we can also pass booleans, objects, urls etc:

``` Javascript
const App = () => {
  return React.createElement(
    "div",
    {},
    [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "Adopt Me!"),
    React.createElement(Pet, {
      animal: "Dog",
      name: "Bubba",
      breed: "English Bulldog"
  }),
    React.createElement(Pet, {
      animal: "Dog",
      name: "Spud",
      breed: "Jack Russell"
  }),
    React.createElement(Pet, {
      animal: "Dog",
      name: "Shona",
      breed: "Boxer"
  }),
    ]  
    );
};
```

## JS Tools

### npm

* [Lesson Outline](https://react-v8.holt.courses/lessons/js-tools/npm)

npm stands for node package manager and requires node.js to be installed on your computer in order to be able to use it. It is the worlds largest software registry and is free to use without any registration or login, which makes it a very popular choice for open source developers who use it to share software.

All npm packages installed will be defined in the package.json file, which is written in JSON. It is very similar to a requirements.txt file, which stores the package name and its version.

We can open and close a terminal within VSCode using the shortcut <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>backtick</kbd>

Make sure your in the project folder that you want to run npm in and we can start a brand new npm project (this will allow us to keep track of our dependancies) with:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Note: the `-y` is added to prevent npm asking you a bunch of config questions, by using the `-y` it will just generate everything for you.

There will now be a package.json file in the adopt_me folder, which is where all the dependencies will be stored (this is very common in projects that use node.js).

### Prettier

* [Lesson Outline](https://react-v8.holt.courses/lessons/js-tools/prettier)

To add an auto formatter called Prettier, which formats the code everytime you hit save, we need to run the following in the terminal:

``` bash
npm i -D prettier@2.7.1
```
Note: the `i` stands for install, which can also be written as `install`. The `-D` flag lets it know to put it in the developer dependencies, this can also be done with the flag `--save-dev`. 

If you go into the package.json file now you can see that prettier is listed in the devDependencies section. Just before the version number is a  little `^` - which means if you go to install this again it will install a patch of that version if available, eg 2.7.2 - for the sake of this course we want to keep it as an exact version, so will remove the `^`, but normally you would leave it there.

Our next step is to create a configuration object to allow us to use prettier. We do that by creating a new file in the root of the project called .prettierrc - within this folder we can configure prettier, for this project we will just use the default by adding an empty object to the file. If you had a preference for 2 or 4 spaces etc, this is the place to configure this.

Next make sure you have the prettier extension installed, and then in the settings of VSCode enable the format on save, then look for prettier - make sure that prettier:enabled and prettier: require config are checked.

When you create new projects, you will need to install prettier and create the .prettierrc file - but you won't have to configure any of the VSCode stuff.

We can also leave commands in the scripts section of our package.json file so that others can use the tool the same way I am. This is configuring it for JavaScript, JSX, TypeScript and TSX.

```json
"scripts": {
    "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.js, jsx, ts, tsx\"",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
```

`prettier` is the CLI command, which means it doesn't have to be installed, it will just find it in the node modules. `--write` means write it back to the file, so it will overwrite everything. We use the `\` to escape the double quote, this is done so prettier is passed the whole string of the path, otherwise bash will expand it for you - `"src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}\"` this tells prettier to format everything inside of the source directory, no matter how deep, as long as it has the following file extensions: js, jsx, ts & tsx.

You should now be able to run

```bash
npm run format
```

in the terminal and it will run the format script we just created, checking for JavaScript, JSX, TypeScript and TSX files in the scr folder and formatting any files that need it. It will list the files, and if they are grey it means nothing has changed in the file, if they are white it means changes were made.

We can select prettier from the dropdown on the right of the terminal and select the output tab - this will show us a debug logout of things that it can't run on. If this is empty it can be a good indication that its not installed properly. Prettier also cannot deal with syntax errors, so for example if you added 3 ; - these would show in the problems tab of the terminal.

### EsLint

* [Lesson Outline](https://react-v8.holt.courses/lessons/js-tools/eslint)

Eslint is an open source project that helps to find and fix simple problems in your JavaScript code.

We can install eslint using npm by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm i -D eslint@8.24.0 eslint-config-prettier@8.5.0
```

We will then need to create a file called .eslintrc.json - this is where we will set up the config for eslint. 

```json
{
    "extends": [
        "eslint:recommended",
        "prettier"
    ],
    "plugins": [],
    "parserOptions":{
        "ecmaVersion": 2022,
        "sourceType": "module",
        "ecmaFeatures": {
            "jsx": true
        }
    },
    "env": {
        "es6": true,
        "browser": true,
        "node": true
    }
}
```

In the extends array we are adding `eslint:recommended` as this will flag any issues that would be raised by esline, and these are issues that should definately be addressed. 

We are also adding `prettier` in the extends array - this doesn't add anything, its just removes formatting stuff from eslint, as we are telling it we are using prettier for the formatting. It's important that prettier always comes last in the array.

Next we have an array for plugins - this will currently be empty. 

Next we will add some parserOptions, we are telling it we which `ecmaVersion` to use - we want the 2022 version of javaScript, the `sourceType` is saying to use modules for imports and exports. As we are going to be using JSX, we include that in the `ecmaFeatures` so it accounts for that. We include the `browser` and `node` as true to prevent any errors relating to them causing an issue, by telling it what kind of environments its going to be working in and what kind of Globals are available.

We will now need to make sure we have the ESLint extension installed in VSCode. Note that you may need to restart VSCode to get it to work.

Finally we can add it into our package.json file, to allow others to run the same thing:

```json
"lint": "eslint \"src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}\" --quiet",
```

This is the same as the format key with the file path - and the `--quiet` part is to prevent it alerting to every little thing, we want it to just let us know when there are problems.

A nice trick we can use when debugging is we can run the following:

```bash
npm run lint -- --debug
```

So we are telling it to run our lint script, the `--` means that we don't want to perform this with npm, but rather eslint, which is the underlying command, followed by the `--debug` flag. This will show you what it loaded, how it loaded it etc. In a few cases it will be able to fix an issue - you can perform this using `--fix`.

### Git

* [Lesson Outline](https://react-v8.holt.courses/lessons/js-tools/git)

We are going to create a .gitignore file, which tells git what files to ignore, so these won't be pushed to our repo. We will need to include the following:

```
node_modules/
dist/
.env
.DS_Store
coverage/
.vscode/
```

### Vite

* [Lesson Outline](https://react-v8.holt.courses/lessons/js-tools/vite)

Vite is what we will be using as our build tool. Other tools that do the same thing include parcel and webpack. Vite was created by Rich Harris, who also created Svelte.

To install we run the following:

```bash
npm i -D vite@3.1.4 @vitejs/plugin-react@2.1.0
```

Back in our index.html file we are now going to delete the 2 React scripts, as we are going to be bundling React into our project. We will also need to change our script that points to App.js to be App.jsx as we will be using JSX add then add `type="module"` to our script tag. This is so Vite knows we aren't using common JS, we are using ES6 modules.

Some React developers don't use the jsx file extension, and just use js - however as we are using Vite, it requires that files have the jsx extension otherwise it won't perform the jsx translation.

To configure Vite, we will need to create a vite.config.js file in the root of our project, and this is what will define our build process:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  root: "src",
});
```

Note: If the index.html file is in the root of the project you don't need the `root: "src" line.

This build process will then go into the src directory (which is listed as the root), it finds the index.html file and then it finds the App.jsx file and will crawl the graph from there. It will understand your JS and CSS.

If you had different heads (index.html is the head file that it will crawl out of), you can identify that to Vite within the config file and it will go find that file.

As we deleted the React script tags in our index.hmtl we will need to install React to allow it to build correctly:

```bash
npm i react@18.2.0 react-dom18.2.0
```

Note: we are installing React and ReactDom without the `-D` flag, this is because React is a production dependancy rather than a developer dependancy.

Vite has something called tree shaking, which is another word for live code inclusion - this means that it only includes code that is being actively used. Dead code elimination is where it goes in and sees if there is any code it can eliminate that is never called. Live code inclusion is in most cases the better of the two.

so rather than using `import ReactDOM from "react-dom";` we could tell it to only import what we are using: `import { createRoot } from "react-dom";` this would make the bundle smaller as its only including what is used. The curly braces are indicating that we are only using part of the package.

Now we are going to add some more scripts in our package.json file:

```json
"dev": "vite",
"build": "vite build",
"preview": "vite preview",
```

Dev will start our development server, build will get ready for production and build the project to static files (this is what you would run in CI), and finally preview will allow us to see the production build before we go to production.

We can now run our script `npm run dev` and it will give us a message letting us know what Local is (which we can <kbd>command</kbd> + click on) and this will open the project in the browser. Note that the port for Vite is always localhost:5173.

## Core React Concepts

### JSX

* [Lesson Outline](https://react-v8.holt.courses/lessons/core-react-concepts/jsx)

Up to now, we have been writing JavaScript that imitates the html that we want to output - so we are having to think of what we want as a finished product, translate that into JavaScript, which is then be translated back into html at the end. JSX is the tool that allows us to just write what it is we want and it performs the multiple hops to get there.

In Pet.jsx I have replaced the original Pet component that was creating html using JavaScript with the JSX equivalent. The JSX is easier to read due to it using actual HMTL tags and we simply pass our props within the tags.

In Pet.jsx we use `export default Pet;` - the default means the top level, so in this case, Pet. We can also declare things with const - and this would require the curly braces to import.

In App.jsx we can remove the import React, as due to this being a jsx file we don't need to import it. When we are calling the Pet component, JSX is able to tell that this is a component rather than a string to render because of the capitalised name. We can then pass in the props to the component. 

It is optional with self-closing tags in html if we close them with the trailing slash `/>`, however this is required in JSX.

We are now getting errors in our App.js file telling us that App and Pet are declared but aren't being used - this is because eslint doesn't currently understand JSX and so we need to configure this:

```bash
npm install -D eslint-plugin-import@2.26.0 eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@6.6.1 eslint-plugin-react@7.31.8
```

and then add the following to the .eslintrc.json file under extends (remember  that the order doesn't matter, we just need to make sure that prettier comes last):

```json
"plugin:import/errors",
"plugin:react/recommended",
"plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended",
```

These plugins just augment eslint, by adding additional capabilities to eslint. These are standard recommended things that should always be followed. 

We will now need to create a new key called rules underneath extends and add the following: 

```json
"rules": {
        "react/prop-types": 0,
        "react/react-in-jsx-scope": 0
    },
```

This is saying don't use prop types as we'll be using typescript, and its also saying that we want to ignore the react in jsx scope rule which required react to be imported to use jsx - by giving these a value of 0 we are saying to ignore these rules (1 means warn, and 2 means error).

For the plugins section, we will add the following:

```json
    "plugins": ["react", "import", "jsx-a11y"],

```

This is saying that we have a React plugin, an import plugin - which allows eslint to follow imports, for example when we export something from one file but import something different into another file, it will follow the export->import and find the error that they don't match. JSX-a11y works making sure things are accessible in your code and pointing them out if not - for example if you put a click listener on something not clickable, this plugin will let you know its not accessible.

Finally we need to add one more new key at the bottom called settings:

```json
"settings": {
        "react": {
            "version": "detect"
        },
        "import/resolver": {
            "node":
            {
                "extensions": [".js", ".jsx"]
            }
        }
    }
```

Eslint will want to know what version of React we're using, so we tell it to go and detect this itself by reading the package.json file. We also need to let it know that when importing we want it to look at .jsx files as well as .js files.

### Hooks

* [Lesson Outline](https://react-v8.holt.courses/lessons/core-react-concepts/hooks)

The SearchParams component is going to use an API that has been created and is hosted by Frontend Mentors so that it should always be available.

When writing our searchParams return function, we are using parentheses so that we can write on the next line, if we just hit enter and started writing on the next line this wouldn't work as it would think that the return had ended, so we need the parentheses to let JavaScript know we're going to the next line.

There are a number of words that are reserved in JavaScript that we cannot use as we normally would - for example class or for. If we wanted to add a class to the div, we would need to use className, and if we wanted to use for in a label we would need to use htmlFor.

```jsx
const SearchParams = () => {
    const location = "Orlando, FL";
    return (
        <div className="search-params">
            <form>
                <label htmlFor="location">
                    Location
                    <input id="location" value={location} placeholder="Location" />
                </label>
                <button>Submit</button>
            </form>
        </div>
    )
}

export default SearchParams;
```

In the input we are using curly braces for the value attributes value - this is because if we used quotation marks around it, this would make it a string and it would use the value inside as a string. By using the curly braces, we are saying use the value of the variable location. This variable is known as a JavaScript expression, and anything that could be an expression can be written within the curly braces - so for example we could also add `.toUpperCase()` within the curly braces and it would use the value of the variable location and change it to be uppercase.

We are now going to import this component into our App.js file. First, remove the pet import and add the SearchParams import, then remove all the Pet components and add the SearchParams component.

```jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import SearchParams from "./SearchParams";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Adopt Me!</h1>
      <SearchParams />
    </div>
  )};

const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render(<App />);
```

NOTE: We have updated the reactDOM import to now include client: `import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client` and we will also need to add a return in the app function to be able to view the SearchParam component, otherwise this would be being declared but never used.

So how does React work, and know when to re-render? The SearchParams component in SearchParams.jsx works is that it will continually re-render this a bunch of times. The re-render functions are run a lot, so need to be fairly fast. Every time an event happens in JavaScript it will re-render everything from top to bottom. So if we type in the input and click a button and a top level DOM event happens - React will say the user has done something so something has probably changed and will re-render itself.

In our code however, we can type whatever we want into the input and nothing will ever change, because nothing is changing the location. If you look in the console, it is telling you what the issue is, and that is that there is no onchange handler - React is telling us that this is the issue.

To enable the location value to change, we will need to use something called a hook. There are numerous different hooks in React (you can find out about each of them in the [Hooks API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)) but for the location we are going to be looking at `useState`.

We will first need to import the hook, then we will need to change our location variable to be an array that holds the name of the variable, and then the setLocation, we then tell the variable that we want the value to useState with the default to display in the brackets, in our example, we are using an empty string as we don't want to have a value.

Now in our input we will need to add an onChange which will take in an event and will then use setLocation which will be the event targets value (so the value of the input in this example)

We are calling the setLocation function to let React know that something has changed and it needs to update itself.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

const SearchParams = () => {
    const [location, setLocation] = useState("");
    return (
        <div className="search-params">
            <form>
                <label htmlFor="location">
                    Location
                    <input
                      onChange={e => setLocation(e.target.value)}
                      id="location"
                      value={location}
                      placeholder="Location"
                    />
                </label>
                <button>Submit</button>
            </form>
        </div>
    )
}

export default SearchParams;
```

This will now allow us to be able to update the text in the input. When our render functions we need to make sure its fast and stateless (stateless means they're not modifying global variables)

So the way to use state inside of the function is to use the hooks, and the hooks are passed to React and then React gives them back to you. In our example location gives you a piece of state which we are keeping track of internally to a React application, and which can change when the user updates the form.

Important! Hooks have to be called every single time in the same order - so they won't work with if's or for loops, as that will change the order that things are called in, which could result in you getting your state back out of order.
